# Automatically apply an electronic seal

Learn how to apply a tamper-evident electronic seal to PDFs at scale using a cloud-based third-party digital certificate. An electronic seal is like an organization's rubber stamp on a paper, but it's more secure. Electronic seals help verify the identity and integrity of official documents such as invoices and financial statementsâ€”reducing risk in your organization by proving that the documents have not been tampered with. They also help ensure documents are legally compliant for various regulatory and legal workflows.
